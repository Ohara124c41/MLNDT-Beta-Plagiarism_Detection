    "    * 0 is no plagiarism, coded with Category 'non'.\n",
    "    * 1 is that there was low use of the original file, coded with Category 'heavy' to indicate heavy revision of text from the original answer.\n",
    "    * 2 is that there was medium use of the original file, coded with Category 'light' to indicate only light revision text from the original answer.\n",
    "    * 3 is that there was heavy plagiarism of the original file, coded with Category 'cut' to indicate the answer was cut and pasted 'as-is' from original answer (no revision).\n",

For the specified Student Task Answer Text (as specified by `file_index`, compare it's n-gram count to the corresponding Wikipedia Task Text n-gram count to calculate the containment, according to the equation below: the intersection of the source and student n-gram counts *divided* by the student n-gram count.\n",

Since plagiarism is a fairly complex task with varying levels, it's often useful to include other measures of similarity. The paper also discusses a feature called **longest common subsequence**.\n",

    "This algorithm depends on looking at two texts and comparing them word by word. You can solve this problem in multiple ways. First, it may be useful to `.split()` each text into lists of comma separated words to compare. Then, you can iterate through each word in the texts and compare them, adding to your value for LCS as you go. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method I recommend for implementing an efficient LCS algorithm is: using a matrix and dynamic programming. **Dynamic programming** is all about breaking a larger problem into a smaller set of subproblems, and building up a complete result without having to repeat any subproblems. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach assumes that you can split up a large LCS task into a combination of smaller LCS tasks. Let's look at a simple example that compares letters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* S = \"ABCD\"\n",
    "* O = \"BD\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see right away that the longest subsequence of _letters_ here is 2 (B and D are in sequence in both strings). And we can calculate this by looking at relationships between each letter in the two strings, S and O. You can also use a matrix to find the LCS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The matrix rules\n",
    "\n",
    "You can break up an LCS task into a series of smaller tasks and efficiently fill up an LCS matrix one cell at a time. Each grid cell only depends on the values in the grid cells that are directly on top and to the left of it, or on the diagonal/top-left. The rules are as follows:\n",
    "* Start with a matrix that has one extra row and column of zeros.\n",
    "* As you traverse your string:\n",
    "    * If there is a match, fill that grid cell with the value to the top-left of that cell *plus* one. So, in our case, when we found a matching B-B, we added +1 to the value in the top-left of the matching cell, 0.\n",
    "    * If there is not a match, take the *maximum* value from either directly to the left or the top cell, and carry that value over to the non-match cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='notebook_ims/matrix_rules.png' width=40% />\n",
    "\n",
    "* After completely filling the matrix, **the bottom-right cell will hold the non-normalized LCS value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matrix treatment can be applied to a set of words instead of letters. Your function should apply this to the words in two texts and return the normalized LCS value."
